<chapter title="Introduction &amp; Installation" file="Introduction">

<cite>Puzzles</cite> is a RISC&nbsp;OS port of Simon Tatham&rsquo;s Portable Puzzle Collection, a collection of 40 one-player puzzle games which are mainly focussed on logic and maths. More details about the collection can be found on Simon&rsquo;s website, at <link ref="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/">https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/</link>.

I discovered the collection through the Android port, and have also played the GTK version available from Simon&rsquo;s site. Since it is described as &ldquo;portable&rdquo;, I decided that RISC&nbsp;OS needed its own version &ndash; and so here it is.


<subhead title="Important">

This version of <cite>Puzzles</cite> is an early alpha release, intended to demonstrate the current state of the RISC&nbsp;OS project and invite feedback. Whilst playable, it is known to be incomplete in many areas, may contain bugs and may be unstable. See the <link ref="Issues">Known Issues</link> section below for more details.


<subhead title="Installation">

<cite>Puzzles</cite> is designed to work with RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;4 or later; it can be used on RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3, but a copy of the Nested Wimp must be installed. It is 26/32-bit neutral, and should therefore run on all hardware systems as long as the 32-bit Shared C Library is installed. If required, this can be found in the System Resources on RISC&nbsp;OS Open Ltd&rsquo;s website at <link ref="https://www.riscosopen.org/content/downloads/common">https://www.riscosopen.org/content/downloads/common</link>.

Nowever, note that it may be slow on older hardware, such as a StrongARM RiscPC.

To install, copy the <file>!Puzzles</file> application from the archive into a suitable place on your hard disc.  It can be run from a floppy disc, but this is not recommended.  Once installed, double-click on the <file>!Puzzles</file> application in the Filer window to load it on to the iconbar.

</chapter>


<chapter title="Playing Puzzles" file="Playing">

To play the puzzles, double-click on the <file>!Puzzles</file> application to load it on to the iconbar.  Once loaded, a <mouse>Select</mouse> click on its iconbar icon will open the <window>Puzzles list</window> window, showing all of the available games. To play a game, click <mouse>Select</mouse> on its icon (or <mouse>Adjust</mouse> to open the game and close the <window>Puzzles list</window> window).


<subhead title="Game Window">

The <window>Game</window> window contains one of the individual puzzles. There are currently no instructions available with the RISC&nbsp;OS port: consult the games at <link ref="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/">https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/</link> for more details of how to play them.

The Game menu offers a number of options for interacting with the game. The current game can be restarted using <menu>Restart</menu>, whilst a new game can be created with the same parameters using <menu>New game</menu>. To change the game parameters, select one of the presets in the <menu>Type</menu> submenu, or use <menu>Type &msep; Custom...</menu> to open the <window>Custom game</window> dialogue box.

A game can be solved (or a hint offered, depending on the specific implementation) by selecting <menu>Solve</menu> &ndash; although not all games offer this facility. The <menu>Undo</menu> and <menu>Redo</menu> options allow moves to be reversed and restored (although cheating death in a game like Inertia will be noted in the final score).

Some games also offer customisation, which can be accessed via <menu>Preferences...</menu>.  Be aware that changing any preferences will cause a new game to be started.

</chapter>


<chapter title="Known Issues" file="Issues">

This version of <cite>Puzzles</cite> is best described as an early Alpha release, and is still very much a work in progress. As such, there are many things which have either not yet been implemented, are incomplete, or contain bugs and mis-features.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of things which are known to need attention.

<list>
<li>The status bar does not correctly redraw when the game canvas changes size. Dragging a window or menu over it will fix the problem.
<li>The canvas redraw can fail when a game canvas changes size: such as when starting a new game with different parameters. Selecting <menu>New game</menu> from the menu to start another new game with the same parameters will resolve this.
<li>The game windows, toolbars and drawing canvases may not be perfectly aligned in EX0&nbsp;EY0 modes.
<li>Font antialiasing is poor.
<li>Graphics can sometimes render poorly, with artefacts on corners.
<li>The Loopy puzzle is not included in the collection.
<li>The games do not have their own icons in the <window>Game List</window> window.
<li>There is no documentation for the games! For now, details of how to play the games, and their controls, can be found on Simon&rsquo;s website (see links above).
<li>The game windows can not be resized from their defaults.
<li>Games can not be saved or loaded.
<li>The printing of games is not supported.
</list>

The intention is to address many of these items before a full release takes place. The implementation of features such as printing will depend on the level of interest shown in the RISC&nbsp;OS port.
