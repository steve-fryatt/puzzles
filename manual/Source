<chapter title="Introduction &amp; Installation" file="Introduction">

<cite>Puzzles</cite> is a RISC&nbsp;OS port of <link ref="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/">Simon Tatham&rsquo;s Portable Puzzle Collection</link>.

<subhead title="Installation">

<cite>Puzzles</cite> is designed to work with RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;4 or later; it can be used on RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3, but a copy of the Nested Wimp must be installed. It is 26/32-bit neutral, and should therefore run on all hardware systems as long as the 32-bit Shared C Library is installed. If required, this can be found in the System Resources on RISC&nbsp;OS Open Ltd&rsquo;s website at <link ref="https://www.riscosopen.org/content/downloads/common">https://www.riscosopen.org/content/downloads/common</link>.

To install, copy the <file>!Puzzles</file> application from the archive into a suitable place on your hard disc.  It can be run from a floppy disc, but this is not recommended.  Once installed, double-click on the <file>!Puzzles</file> application in the Filer window to load it on to the iconbar.
